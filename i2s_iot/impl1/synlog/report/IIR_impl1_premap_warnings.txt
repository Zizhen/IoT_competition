@W: MT529 :"c:\users\sec29\desktop\i2s_iot\iir_cornell.v":50:0:50:5|Found inferred clock IIR4_18bit_fixed|state_clk which controls 234 sequential elements including f1_y_n2[17:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
