WARNING - par: The SN pin is not available for use as a general purpose I/O pin when the SLAVE_SPI_PORT attribute is enabled.  The SN pin should be tied high with an external pull-up if you are not using the Slave SPI port for configuration.
The following 1 signal is selected to use the primary clock routing resources:
    wb_clk_i_c (driver: wb_clk_i, clk load #: 79)


The following 2 signals are selected to use the secondary clock routing resources:
    config_bits_0 (driver: CONF/SLICE_93, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 28, ce load #: 0)
    config_wr (driver: RECEIVER_WB/SLICE_37, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 0, ce load #: 23)

Signal wb_rst_i_c is selected as Global Set/Reset.

*****************************************************************
Info: NBR allows conflicts(one node used by more than one signal)
      in the earlier iterations. In each iteration, it tries to  
      solve the conflicts while keeping the critical connections 
      routed as short as possible. The routing process is said to
      be completed when no conflicts exist and all connections   
      are routed.                                                
Note: NBR uses a different method to calculate timing slacks. The
      worst slack and total negative slack may not be the same as
      that in TRCE report. You should always run TRCE to verify  
      your design. Thanks.
