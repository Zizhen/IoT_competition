@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"d:\uiuc\2017_spring\ece_396\iot_competition\char_cntrl.v":16:0:16:5|Found inferred clock pll1|CLKOP_inferred_clock which controls 232 sequential elements including f1.out. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
