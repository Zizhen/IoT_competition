Design Errors/Warnings
----------------------

WARNING - map: Using local reset signal 'i_sys_rst' to infer global GSR net.
WARNING - map: The reset of EBR 'top_reveal_coretop_instance/top_la0_inst_0/trig
     _u/te_0/pmi_ram_dpXO3Lbinarynonespeedasyncdisablereg112112/pmi_ram_dpXbnone
     sadr11211211528818_0_0_0' cannot be controlled. The local reset is not
     connected to any control signal and set to GND. The global reset is
     disabled via GSR property. To control the EBR reset, either connect the
     local reset to a control signal or force the GSR property to be enabled.

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'i_sys_rst' of the design has been inferred as Global
        Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is 'i_sys_rst'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
        

Run Time and Memory Usage
-------------------------

   Total CPU Time: 1 secs  
   Total REAL Time: 0 secs  
   Peak Memory Usage: 63 MB
